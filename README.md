# A closer look at H1b visas over 5 years from 2011 to 2016
Using a kaggle dataset that has all H1b visas for the years 2011 to 2016. A interesting look at the companies that are filling roles with the H1b system and what type of jobs are being filled. With all the press about H1bs coming from our goverment I thought it would be interesting to see why the H1b system is taking so much heat. For this project I use R with dplyr, maps, ggplot and rmarkdown.
